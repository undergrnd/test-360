        There was something in the tree. It was difficult to tell from the
        ground, but Rachael could see movement. She squinted her eyes and peered
        in the direction of the movement, trying to decipher exactly what she
        had spied. The more she peered, however, the more she thought it might
        be a figment of her imagination. Nothing seemed to move until the moment
        she began to take her eyes off the tree. Then in the corner of her eye,
        she would see the movement again and begin the process of staring again.
